1.It works on the textual format.         VS      1. It works on the binary protocol.

2.There is head of line blocking          VS      2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP 
  that connection is required for                    connection is required for multiple requests.
  multiple blocks all the requests                
  behind it until it doesnâ€™t get  
  its all resources.

3.It uses requests resource Inlining      VS      3.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects
for use getting multiple pages                       all multiple pages 

4.It compresses data by itself.           VS      4. It uses HPACK for data compression.
